# Phase 1: Foundations

To become an AI Security Engineer, you need a strong foundation in three key areas:
1.  **Programming:** The art of speaking to machines.
2.  **Mathematics:** The language that describes AI algorithms.
3.  **Cybersecurity:** The mindset for understanding risks and threats.

In this phase, we will focus on these three pillars. If you lack basic knowledge in any of these, please do not skip this phase. You cannot build a strong tower on a weak foundation.
