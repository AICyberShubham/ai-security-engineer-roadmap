### 1.1 Programming: The Language of AI

**Why this is important:** Python is the lingua franca of AI/ML. Its simplicity, readability, and incredible ecosystem of libraries make it the undisputed choice for researchers and developers alike.

#### Core Concepts:

-   **Syntax & Data Types:** Variables, strings, integers, floats, booleans.
-   **Data Structures:** Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets. Know when to use each.
-   **Control Flow:** `if-elif-else` statements, `for` loops, `while` loops.
-   **Functions:** Writing reusable code with functions, parameters, and return values.
-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Understand classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. Many ML libraries are built using OOP principles.
-   **File I/O & Error Handling:** Reading from and writing to files, and using `try-except` blocks to write robust code.
