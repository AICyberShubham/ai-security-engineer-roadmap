### 1.2 Mathematics for Machine Learning

**Why this is important:** Math is the language of machine learning. You don't need to be a pure mathematician, but you need strong intuition to understand *how* and *why* algorithms work. This is crucial for debugging, tuning, and innovating.

#### Core Concepts:

-   **Linear Algebra:** The language of data. Vectors, matrices, dot products, transformations, eigenvalues/eigenvectors. (Used everywhere, especially in Deep Learning).
-   **Calculus:** The engine of optimization. Derivatives, gradients, the chain rule. (Essential for understanding how models learn via Gradient Descent).
-   **Probability & Statistics:** The framework for uncertainty. Mean, median, variance, probability distributions (Normal, Poisson), Bayes' Theorem. (Used for understanding data, model evaluation, and algorithms like Naive Bayes).
