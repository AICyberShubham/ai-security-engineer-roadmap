### 1.3 Cybersecurity Fundamentals

**Why this is important:** AI models are software. They are deployed on networks, they handle data, and they have vulnerabilities. A strong grasp of core security principles is non-negotiable to protect the systems you build.

#### Core Concepts:

-   **The CIA Triad:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. The three pillars of information security.
-   **Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures (CVEs):** Understand what they are and how to look them up.
-   **OWASP Top 10:** Be aware of the most critical web application security risks (e.g., Injection, Broken Authentication).
-   **Networking Fundamentals:** Understand TCP/IP, HTTP/S, DNS, and firewalls. Know how data moves across a network.
-   **Basic Cryptography:** What is encryption? Understand the difference between symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption and what they are used for.
