Phase 1: The Foundations (Months 1-3)
Goal: You cannot build a skyscraper on a weak foundation. This phase ensures you have the essential building blocks in Programming, Mathematics, and Cybersecurity. By the end of these three months, you will be able to write clean Python code, understand the core math concepts behind AI, and have a solid grasp of fundamental security principles.

Month 1: Python & Core Programming
Goal: Become proficient in Python, the language of AI. You will learn to think like a programmer and write clean, modular code.

Week 1: Python Basics - Variables & Data Types
Theory: Variables are containers for storing data values. Data types are classifications that tell Python what kind of data a variable holds. The main types are:
Integer (int): Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5).
Float (float): Numbers with a decimal point (e.g., 9.81, -0.01).
String (str): Text enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Hello", 'AI Security').
Boolean (bool): Represents one of two values: True or False.

# Storing security event data
event_id = 101
threat_score = 8.7
event_description = "Suspicious login pattern detected"
is_critical = True

print(f"Event ID: {event_id}, Type: {type(event_id)}")
print(f"Threat Score: {threat_score}, Type: {type(threat_score)}")
print(f"Description: {event_description}, Type: {type(event_description)}")
print(f"Is Critical: {is_critical}, Type: {type(is_critical)}")

Action: Write a Python script that defines variables for a hypothetical security alert: alert_id, source_ip, timestamp, severity (as a string), and is_resolved (as a boolean). Print them out using an f-string.
Week 2: Data Structures - Lists & Dictionaries
Theory: Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data.
Lists: Ordered, mutable (changeable) collections of items. Think of them as a shopping list. You access items by their index (position).
Dictionaries (dict): Unordered collections of key-value pairs. Think of them as a real-world dictionary where you look up a word (the key) to get its definition (the value).

# A list of open ports on a server
open_ports = [22, 80, 443, 8080]
print(f"First open port: {open_ports[0]}")

# A dictionary representing a user's login record
user_record = {
    "username": "admin",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "login_time": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z",
    "failed_attempts": 0
}
print(f"User {user_record['username']} logged in from {user_record['ip_address']}.")
